# How?

----
***Spoiler warning***: This is actually a pretty fun problem
to solve, and I such I recommend trying to work it out yourself
before consulting this document. For starters, I recommend reading
up on [how to write a single quine](http://www.madore.org/~david/computers/quine.html)
and trying it out yourself. Then, I recommend trying to write a
quine relay with two languages by hand -- and from there, you 
can try writing one with three languages. This is the process
by which I started getting an idea of how I would write a quine
relay generator for an arbitrary number of languages.
